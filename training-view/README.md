# TrainingView: Advanced Visualization for Machine‑Learning Training

## Vision

*TrainingView* transforms model‑training oversight by introducing powerful, finance‑inspired charts that reveal volatility, momentum, and hidden patterns normally lost between ordinary scalar plots.

## Why It Matters

Traditional dashboards show average loss or accuracy per epoch. They hide the micro‑swings and sudden spikes that whisper "instability" or "missed optimisation".  Trading pros watch candles, volume, and momentum to navigate chaotic markets—why not borrow the same clarity for chaotic optimisation loops?

## Our Edge

I’m *Okereke Chukwudi Donald*, a University of Windsor researcher and ex‑prop‑firm trader (2020 – 2024). Four years of living on chart nuance taught me to read volatility at a glance. TrainingView channels that hard‑won visual literacy into MLOps.

## Core Features (FURPS Snapshot)

| Area               | Key Requirements                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Functionality*  | 🔹 SDKs for PyTorch / TensorFlow & friends  🔹 Candlestick charts of loss & other scalars  🔹 Per‑batch logging  🔹 Run comparison dashboards |
| *Usability*      | 🔹 One‑line logger.log() drop‑in  🔹 Web UI with drag‑and‑drop widgets  🔹 Tooltips that decode finance lingo for ML users                  |
| *Reliability*    | 🔹 Accurate, atomic writes  🔹 Graceful retry on network hiccups                                                                              |
| *Performance*    | 🔹 Millisecond‑overhead logging  🔹 Fast rendering for million‑point traces                                                                   |
| *Supportability* | 🔹 Full docs & examples  🔹 Open roadmap  🔹 Community forum                                                                                  |

## Candlestick Example


Epoch 5           High
 |                |
 |      wick      |
Open ── body ── Close   ← red = loss ↑ within epoch
 |      wick      |
Low              


One glance tells you the epoch was volatile and closed worse than it opened.

## Roadmap Highlights

* Per‑run random‑colour candles for quick visual grouping
* Volatility indicators adapted from ATR / Bollinger Bands
* Gradient‑"volume" bars beneath candlesticks
* Optional pattern‑detection alerts (spikes, trend reversals)

## Getting Started

bash
pip install trainingview


python
from trainingview import Tracker
tracker = Tracker(project="my‑cnn")
for batch, data in enumerate(loader):
    loss = train_step(data)
    tracker.log(loss=loss)


Open the dashboard at localhost:7000 to watch candles form in real‑time.
